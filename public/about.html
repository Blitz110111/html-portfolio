I specialize in turning ideas into interactive, functional digital experiences that not only looks great but also performs seamlessly. With a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies, i thrive at the intersection of design and logic. From crafting intuitive user interfaces to optimizing performance and writing efficient code, i enjoy every step of the development process. </p>
  <p>I work with modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more, constantly learning and evolving with the ever-changing tech landscape. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and building with purpose - whether it's a portfolio site, an e-commerce platform, or a complex web application.  </p>
